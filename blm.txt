Black Lives Matter.

That shouldn't be controversial. And it's not an invitation to say which other lives matter. Stand with protesters fighting for justice--for George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor--and against police brutality and mass incarceration. Don't leap to dismiss the movement by pointing to property damage or violence by the opportunistic few (who are often white, often police officers). People are being murdered because they are Black. Take their communities seriously.

Black Lives Matter. But not only when they're extinguished. Don't dismiss people saying the entire system--our laws, economics, healthcare system, etc.--structurally and systematically disadvantage them. It's uncomfortable to be reminded of our privilege and complicity in a racist system. But it's a bit more uncomfortable to be victim to it. The absolute least we owe to people fighting for a better, fairer world is to listen, earnestly. Then to speak. Then to act.

I know I haven't done enough. It's too easy to live every day feeling non-racist and think that's a contribution to the anti-racist cause. This is a moment for all of us to do better.

Thanks to my friends speaking out, sharing reading material, donation links, and protesting. People of color shouldn't have to always bear the burden of educating the rest of us about their plight. But they usually do.
