The claim that individual cops can be good is rooted in white supremacist mythology that suggests racism is an individual act committed by anybody. Policing is not a question of individualism. It is not as if a random individual gets a gun, a badge, a police car, and a blue uniform. The police are a highly organized institution with systemic power. In order to understand any institution, it is important you start with the history of that institution, the institution of modern day policing evolved from the slave patrol system.

To suggest that there are good cops is like saying there’s good slave patrols or good colonizers. It acts as if policing is an individual act that isn’t a product of racial capitalism. A cop might have “good intentions”, but these good intentions don’t change the fact that they are a part of a system that is rooted in anti-Blackness. These “good intentions” don’t change the fact that the system they work for criminalizes the whole Black community.

“The police state was originally formed out of discriminatory practices made to uphold racist and prejudiced ideas. This in tandem with a systematically flawed incarceration system disproportionately affecting brown people make the police, as a system inevitably biased and destructive to society.”

“Any position of power, specifically one able to determine the life or death of another person, will attract those who have narcissistic and psychopathic personalities, in which the abuse of their authority is not only what drives them, but also what ends up contaminating the system in its entirety, seen in how it’s looked down upon for a cop to report another cop, thus letting this cycle continue and grow.”
