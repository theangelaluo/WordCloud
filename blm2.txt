1. There are a lot of people turning Black Lives Matter into a trend, and a that is a gross misrepresentation of this issue. We need your actions, not your virtue signaling

2. Check. On. Your. Black. Friends. They are dealing with a lot. I just got through a whole discussion with a Non-Black latino person from my HS who is arguing that Black people are just playing the victim card. That is the least of it. We are so tired, more than you could even realize.

3. There are a few things to realize about the looting:
-White people have rioted/looted after SPORTS GAMES and the gov't literally excused it and said their feelings were justified. But when Black people do it, after YEARS of trying to peacefully protest and not being listened to? FOH
- We should be clear that white people are mostly the ones starting the looting/ destruction of property in these protests. A majority of these protests start peacefully, and then agitators or cops start to get things out of control. And, in any case, looting may not be great, but this ignores a lot of context, and looting =/= the literal continual murder of Black people my law enforcement in this country
- Looting is a legitimate form of protest when fighting against a system that values goods and services over human lives, because it hits the Gov't where it'll listen: its pocket books. We saw it with the Boston Tea Party for American liberation against the British, and with the Stonewall Riots for LGBTQ rights, and we're seeing it now for Black lives Large corporations (and some small businesses, though they are greatest loss in these occurrences) have insurance. Their stores can be rebuilt. Black lives can't be brought back.

4. It's okay to be scared right now. I'm scared everyday I walk outside. But we need to keep this momentum going. It takes everyone to make a difference, and all of our small actions add up to something big.

5. Freedom of Speech =/= Freedom from Consequence. Have conversations with the people in your lives who may not be seeing these things clearly. They may not come around, or it might take more work, but it is necessary.

If anyone wants to reach out and talk, or wants links to resources and places to help, or readings to do some education, please let me know. But we can not be silent. Not anymore.
